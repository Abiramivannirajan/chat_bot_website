        <h4>Detailed Aptitude Interview Preparation Guide</h4>
  
        <h5>1. Numerical Ability</h5>
        <p>Understanding the core concepts of Numerical Ability is crucial because most competitive exams and interviews focus heavily on these areas.</p>
  
        <h6>Percentages:</h6>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> A percentage expresses a number as a fraction of 100.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A product is sold for $250. If the profit is 20%, find the selling price.</p>
        <p>Profit = 20% of 250 = 0.20 × 250 = $50.<br> Selling price = Cost price + Profit = 250 + 50 = $300.</p>
        <p><strong>Shortcuts:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>For percentage increase: <code>New Value = Original Value × (1 + Percentage Increase)</code></li>
          <li>For percentage decrease: <code>New Value = Original Value × (1 - Percentage Decrease)</code></li>
        </ul>
  
        <h6>Ratios:</h6>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> A ratio represents the relationship between two numbers, showing how many times the first number contains the second.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The ratio of boys to girls in a class is 3:4. If there are 60 students, how many boys are there?</p>
        <p>Total parts = 3 + 4 = 7. Number of boys = (3/7) × 60 = 25 boys.</p>
  
        <h6>Profit & Loss:</h6>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Profit is the amount by which the selling price exceeds the cost price.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a shopkeeper buys an article for $500 and sells it for $600, what is the profit percentage?</p>
        <p>Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) × 100 = (100 / 500) × 100 = 20%.</p>
  
        <h6>Simple & Compound Interest:</h6>
        <p><strong>Simple Interest Formula:</strong> SI = (P × R × T) / 100</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> $1000 invested at 5% annual interest for 3 years gives SI = $150.</p>
        <p><strong>Compound Interest Formula:</strong> CI = P × (1 + R/100)^T - P</p>
  
        <h5>2. Logical Reasoning</h5>
  
        <h6>Syllogisms:</h6>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Deductive reasoning problems that involve drawing conclusions from given premises.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> "All dogs are animals. All animals are living beings. Therefore, all dogs are living beings."</p>
        <p><strong>Shortcuts:</strong> Use Venn diagrams to analyze logical relationships.</p>
  
        <h6>Blood Relations:</h6>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Identifying relationships between family members.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If A is the brother of B and B is the mother of C, A is the uncle of C.</p>
        <p><strong>Shortcuts:</strong> Draw a family tree to simplify relationships.</p>
  
        <h6>Coding-Decoding:</h6>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Deciphering messages based on patterns.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If "CAT" is written as "DBU", what is the code for "DOG"? The code is "EPH".</p>
  
        <h6>Seating Arrangement:</h6>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Arranging people in a circle or line based on given conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Shortcuts:</strong> Use diagrams to visually organize the arrangement.</p>
  
        <h5>3. Data Interpretation</h5>
        <p>Analyzing data from pie charts, bar graphs, line graphs, and tables.</p>
  
        <h6>Example:</h6>
        <p>If a company’s market share is represented by a pie chart, calculate the competitor’s share using the given angles.</p>
  
        <h5>4. Time Management Tips</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mental Math:</strong> Learn shortcuts for quick calculations.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice Speed:</strong> Set time limits and gradually reduce them.</li>
          <li><strong>Set a Target:</strong> Solve 10 questions in 15 minutes and improve over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Focus on Accuracy First:</strong> Speed is important, but correctness matters more.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h4>Interview Preparation Tips:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Communication is Key:</strong> Always explain your thought process.</li>
          <li><strong>Mock Interviews:</strong> Simulate real interview environments.</li>

          <h4>Detailed Guide</h4>
      
          <h5>1. Self-Introduction</h5>
          <p><strong>Concept:</strong> The first impression matters. A well-structured self-introduction sets the tone for the interview.</p>
          <p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Current Status:</strong> Briefly introduce yourself (name, background).</li>

          </ul>

I specialize in Angular and have built scalable applications that improved user engagement by 30%. I'm excited about this opportunity because your company values innovation, which aligns with my passion for problem-solving."</p>
      
          <h5>2. Strengths & Weaknesses</h5>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Choose strengths relevant to the job and provide examples.</li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Mention areas for improvement but show how you're working on them.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Example (Strength):</strong> "I am highly detail-oriented, which helps me identify small errors in code before they become major issues."</p>
          <p><strong>Example (Weakness):</strong> "I used to struggle with delegating tasks, but I have improved by learning to trust my team’s abilities."</p>
      
          <h5>3. Behavioral Questions (Using STAR Method)</h5>
          <p><strong>Concept:</strong> HR interviews focus on past experiences to evaluate problem-solving, teamwork, and leadership skills.</p>
          <p><strong>STAR Method:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Situation:</strong> Briefly describe a work scenario.</li>
            <li><strong>Task:</strong> Explain your responsibility in that situation.</li>
            <li><strong>Action:</strong> Detail the steps you took.</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Share the positive outcome.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Question:</strong> "Tell me about a time you resolved a conflict in a team."</p>
          <p><strong>Answer (STAR):</strong> "In my previous role, two team members had conflicting ideas about a project approach. As the project lead, I scheduled a meeting (Situation). I encouraged both sides to share their views (Task). I then proposed a hybrid solution combining their best ideas (Action). This resulted in a successful project and improved teamwork (Result)."</p>
      
          <h5>4. Salary Negotiation</h5>
          <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Negotiating salary confidently ensures fair compensation.</p>
          <p><strong>Techniques:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Research Market Rates:</strong> Use platforms like Glassdoor and LinkedIn Salary.</li>
            <li><strong>Highlight Your Value:</strong> Justify your request with skills and achievements.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Flexible:</strong> Consider other benefits (bonuses, stock options, remote work).</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Based on my experience and industry standards, I believe a salary of $X is reasonable. However, I’m open to discussing other benefits that align with my skills."</p>
